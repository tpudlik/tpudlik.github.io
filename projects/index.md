My recent projects have revolved around interfacing a [Raspberry Pi][] with
the physical environment.  Sometimes, the Pi acts as a receiver, with
temperature, humidity, ultrasonic, or IR sensors; sometimes as a transmitter,
with an IR emitter or a printhead. Sometimes, it runs a web server, yielding
an "internet of things" device.  The specific devices I have built are,

*   [HydroPi](/projects/hydropi), a hydroponics system based on the Raspberry
    Pi.
*   [Paparazzi bird feeder](/projects/birdfeeder).
*   [RaspAC](/projects/raspac), a Raspberry Pi AC controller.
*   [Bioprinter](/projects/bioprinter) for printing cells onto Petri dishes.

I am an occasional contributor to the special functions module of
[SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy).  I wrote the current implementation
of spherical Bessel functions, and am working on and off on a better algorithm
for evaluating the confluent hypergeometric function.

I sometimes ask and answer questions at [Stack Exchange: Physics][].  I am
especially proud of [my explanation of a simple DC motor][DC motor],
easily the most enjoyable piece of physics I did in graduate school.

I am also slowly working my way through Project Euler.
