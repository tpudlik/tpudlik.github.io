I am a software engineer at Google.  I was originally trained as a theoretical
physicist, spent a couple years predicting the impact of network
maintenance, then three more in the lidar group at [Waymo](http://waymo.com).
I currently work on [Pigweed](http://pigweed.dev).

This webpage contains descriptions of my grad school
[research work](/research) and various [side projects](/projects).
