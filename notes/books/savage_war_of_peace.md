A history of the 1954&ndash;1962 war in Algeria, by Alistair Horne.
Meticulously detailed, thoroughly depressing, utterly fascinating. It could
constitute the basis for excellent fiction.

The broad theme is the seemingly inevitable escalation of communal violence,
examined in meticulous detail: terrorism leading to lynchings, police
brutality, assassination of moderates, and more terrorism. The people at the
center of this are invariably tragic characters who ought to know better but
cannot remain passive in the face of the other side's atrocities&mdash;doctors
who aid bomb makers, veterans of the Resistance who engage in torture,
four-star generals who go underground to orchestrate the slaughter of
civilians. Perhaps most poignant is the figure of General Challe, a devoted
soldier so distraught at the prospect of withdrawal from Algeria (which would
mean leaving his Muslim harki regiments to be massacred as colonial
collaborators) that he joins an abortive putsch against de Gaulle's
government&mdash;as General Gouraud after him, "too late to render much
assistance to the putsch but in time to shatter in fragments a lifetime's
career of honour and distinction."

I marked many passages in my copy and hope eventually to put some of them down
here.  Unfortunately, the book shines at the level of the paragraph or chapter
rather than the sentence, making it difficult to excerpt.

I originally bought this book because it was [mentioned in passing in *The
Economist*](http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21677604-study-military-arrogance-and-its-terrible-consequences-their-own-worst-enemy).
