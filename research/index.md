I received my Ph.D. in Physics from [Boston University][] for theoretical work
on 2D materials and Bose&ndash;Einstein condensates in optical lattices,
carried out under [David Campbell][]. Earlier in my graduate career, I devoted
about a year to experimental physics, developing protocols for chemical vapor
deposition of graphene in the group of [Anna Swan and Bennett Goldberg][].
Before entering my physics doctoral program, I spent a year studying economics
at [Caltech][].

As an undergraduate, I carried out Monte Carlo simulations of random 
walks, Ising models and the &phi;<sup>4</sup> theory under [William Loinaz][].

## 2D Materials ##

My latest work explores the idea of employing 2D materials as active media in
novel electromagnetic devices.  If such devices could be realized, they would
offer tunable sources in the underserved terahertz range of the spectrum.
In collaboration with [my advisor][David Campbell] and [Antonio Castro-Neto][]
I developed a quantum model of the magnetron, one possible design for a 2D
solid-state source.  Our work is available as a
[preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07669).

Much earlier, I wrote a *Mathematica* notebook for finding the band
structures of graphene nanoribbons in the presence of magnetic fields; you
can find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/tpudlik/Graphene-nanoribbons). It
reproduces the results of a number of papers on the subject.


## BECs in Optical Lattices ##

Much of my Ph.D. was devoted to studying the dynamics of ultracold atoms in
optical lattices. Their behavior can be very precisely monitored in
experiments, making them promising candidates for simulators of less
accessible condensed matter systems.  They are also prospective platforms for
quantum computing, an application that requires a better understanding of the
atoms' entanglement.

My collaborators and I studied the dynamics of entanglement in the two-site
optical lattice.  We found that for certain special initial conditions (near
the stable fixed points of the mean-field equations of motion) the
entanglement behaves very simply, undergoing a sequence of quantum revivals.
What is more, these special initial conditions are the only ones for which
entanglement is present in the system for an appreciable time.  This suggests
entanglement might be generated for other initial conditions if the system is
driven towards the stable fixed point states.  We carried out simulations
using the quantum jump method to show that this is indeed the case.  Our paper
on the subject is posted on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0784) and
has been
[published in <em>Physical Review A</em>](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.88.063606).

We have also applied semiclassical techniques to the dimer problem, trying to
understand the most important features of the system's behavior in terms of
quantum corrections to a classical model.  In particular, we derived a simple
yet accurate semiclassical  estimate of the tunneling rate between the wells.
The paper is on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0769) and in
[<em>Physical Review A</em>](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.90.053610).
A more visual summary is provided by the poster I presented at the BEC2014
conference in Levico, Italy ([pdf](BEC2014_poster.pdf)).


## Lattice Monte Carlo ##

My undergraduate senior thesis was on *Lattice Simulations of the
&phi;<sup>4</sup> Theory and Related Systems* ([pdf](pudlik_Amherst_thesis.pdf)).
I like to think the second and third chapters provide a pleasant introduction
to Monte Carlo methods.


## Economics ##

I never did any serious work in the field, but I *did* write one vaguely
amusing term paper about dorm damage fines: *Towards a Theory of Dorm Damage*
([pdf](DD.pdf)).


## Microwave Spectroscopy ##

Back in 2006, I spent a summer acquiring and analyzing vibrational spectra of
the 1,1-difluoroethylene&ndash;hydrogen fluoride complex.   after three more
years of efforts by others, the structure of this complex was determined.  I
am a coauthor of the paper announcing the results,
[J. Chem. Phys. <b>131</b>, 204301 (2009)](https://link.aip.org/link/doi/10.1063/1.3250865).
